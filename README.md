📚 Data Structures in Python
Welcome to the Data Structures in Python repository!
This collection contains clean, well-documented implementations of fundamental data structures using Python. Each structure is built from scratch to help learners and developers understand the core logic behind these essential components in computer science.


📦 What's Inside?
✅ Linear Data Structures
Singly Linked List

Doubly Linked List

Stack (Array-based & Linked List-based)

Queue (Array-based & Linked List-based)

Circular Queue

🌳 Non-Linear Data Structures
Tree (Generic Tree)

Binary Search Tree (BST)

Graph (Adjacency List & Matrix)

🔐 Hashing
Hash Table

Basic hashing with collision handling (e.g., chaining or linear probing)

🚀 Getting Started
Requirements
Python 3.6+

No external libraries required       

🧠 Purpose
This repository is ideal for:

Computer science students

Coding interview preparation

Python learners exploring core data structures

Anyone who wants to learn by building from scratch
